## Hello there 👋

My name is Joaquín Peñuela-Parra. I am a colombian Physicist graduated from Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes) with experience in areas such as Theoretical Condensed Matter, Phenomenology Particle Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. 

I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineering in the group of Dr. Juan José Mendoza Arenas at the the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). In this group we use tensor networks to investigate quantum materials, quantum computing, quantum transport and fluid turbulence. My work focuses on correlated quantum systems driven out of equilibrium and spans two complementary projects. In the first, I use the Mesoscopic Leads formalism—a recent approach capable of treating many‑body systems at finite temperature with non‑quadratic interactions and strong system–reservoir coupling—to study fermionic transport induced by thermal/chemical potential biases and time-dependent external driving, with the aim of optimizing rectification behavior. In the second, I use the Superfermionic Representation—a recent method to map density matrix states into states vectors that exists in a double Hilbert space—to compute nonequilibrium steady states of Hubbard‑like models governed by Lindblad open‑system dynamics, aiming to understand and enhance superconducting correlations through dissipation control.
