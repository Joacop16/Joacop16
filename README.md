### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Joaquin PeÃ±uela Parra. I am a colombian Physicist graduated from Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes) with experience in areas such as Theoretical Condensed Matter, Phenomenology Particle Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) in the group of Dr. Juan JosÃ© Mendoza Arenas at the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Materials Science of the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). In this group we use tensor networks to investigate quantum materials, quantum computing, quantum transport and fluid turbulence. In particular, my current work consists of using tensor networks algorithms to study electrical transport generated by incident light coupled to a Boundary-driven Open Quantum System with the aim of optimizing rectification behavior.
