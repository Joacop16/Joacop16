### Hello there 👋

My name is Joaquín Peñuela-Parra. I am a colombian Physicist graduated from Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes) with experience in areas such as Theoretical Condensed Matter, Phenomenology Particle Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I am currently doing a Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineering in the group of Dr. Juan José Mendoza Arenas at the the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). In this group we use tensor networks to investigate quantum materials, quantum computing, quantum transport and fluid turbulence. My current work consists of using tensor network algorithms to study fermionic transport in one-dimensional chains. The transport is induced by thermal/chemical potential biases and time-dependent external driving. The aim is to optimize electric and thermal rectifying behavior. I use the Mesoscopic Leads formalism; a recent method capable of tackling many-body systems at finite temperature, non-quadratic interactions, and strong system reservoir coupling.
